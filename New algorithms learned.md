#Slow and Fast pointers Algorithm/Concept

This algorithm used to get the middle value in LinkedList,
by declare two pointers slow and fast started at index 0

then increment the slow with 1 , but increment the fast by 2
when fast pointer reach the end of linkedList, that mean that slow pointer stopped at middle
