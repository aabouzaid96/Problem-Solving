#Slow and Fast pointers Algorithm/Concept

This algorithm used to get the middle value in LinkedList,
by declare two pointers Slow and Fast started at index 0 (head of linkedlist)

then increment the Slow with 1 , but increment the Fast by 2

when Fast pointer reach the end of linkedList, that means that Slow pointer stopped at middle.
